# NyuDatathon21

Hello! 

This repository contains the work of Team Freshmen for NYU's Love Data Week Datathon. We chose Track 2, "Helping the NYU Community," and used L2 Political's 
historical voter files to accomplish two main challenges. 

First, we tried to generate "surrogates" of the data by to increase the anonymity of voters by [insert what was done] in the file in [insert file name]. 

Second, we created some interesting data visualizations with L2 Political data. We originally wanted to map gerrymandering trends but were largely unable to due to
time and feasibility. For the swing states Florida, Michigan, and Wisconsin, we mapped whether or not voters voted in those states in the 2008 and 2012 elections 
in the folder [insert folder name]. We extracted data into CSV's with L2_Political. The resulting visualizations are in the folder [insert folder 
name]. We hope these visualizations (where green dots mean the individual voted, and purple dots mean they didn't) help show trends across elections and make the data easier to use!
